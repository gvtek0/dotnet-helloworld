# dotnet-helloworld

Simple Hello World in C#/dot net core, working towards building a simple app using  MS' tutorials and then containerizing. 

One of the main goals of this is to simulate my developers' workflow at work so I can better understand what they are dealing with, which will help me see where I can reduce friction points in their dev process. An issue that is currently being experienced is being able to hit break points, and this will help me emulate what rhwy see and potentially figure out a solution with both local dev environment as well as through a remote interface, potentially like using Vagrant environments if we move to all Linux containers, which is an ultimate goal of mine.
